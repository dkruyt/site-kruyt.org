      <description>Running a webserver in Kubernetes is easy, but a mailserver is more challenging. Most of the challenging things has todo with your ip infrastructure, ingress and loadbalancer within Kubernetes. Here are things I learned when I was deploying a mailserver based on Postfix on Kubernetes with metallb and nginx ingress. If you have a different setup, things could apply or not.
Prevent mail loops on your secondary MX Your postfix MX pod is running maybe on a private ip RFC1918, this is fine.</description>

      <description>When I was looking at some Nginx caching settings to improve them on a load balanced static content farm. I noticed that the etag headers difference between servers for the same file when they should be the same.
So first what is a etag header?
From WikipediA
 The ETag or entity tag is part of HTTP, the protocol for the World Wide Web. It is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for web cache validation, which allows a client to make conditional requests.</description>
