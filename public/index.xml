      <description>Running a webserver in Kubernetes is easy, but a mailserver is more challenging. Most of the challenging things has todo with your ip infrastructure, ingress and loadbalancer within Kubernetes. Here are things I learned when I was deploying a mailserver based on Postfix on Kubernetes with metallb and nginx ingress. If you have a different setup, things could apply or not.
Prevent mail loops on your secondary MX Your postfix MX pod is running maybe on a private ip RFC1918, this is fine.</description>

Also I am using LXD at work to create test setup for al sorts of Linux OS&amp;rsquo;s and applications. Most &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; Linux OS&amp;rsquo;s are already in the LXD image repository. But sometime&amp;rsquo;s I need a non free Linux OS. Such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, or SLES for short. Off-course I can run this in a VPS just by installing it from an ISO.</description>

GitLab flow The GitLab flow is as following, you have one or more dev/working branches. To push code to the staging environment you do this via an merge request in GitLab, en to get this code in to production. Again via a merge request from the master branch to the production branch.</description>

With the first print I was amazed how good the quality now is on these budget printers. My last experience with 3d printing was about 10 years ago and the quality was quite different then on budget printers. So I am quite happy with this printer.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t cache everything Caching is good, but we don&amp;rsquo;t want to cache everything in ghost, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to cache the admin and preview pages in ghost. Add the following in the sub vcl_recv part.
# Did not cache the admin and preview pages if (req.url ~ &amp;#34;/(admin|p|ghost)/&amp;#34;) { return (pass); } restart Varnish to activate the changes.</description>

ZeroTier on a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter With the new EdgeOS version 2 firmware for the EdgeRouter it is now possible to install ZeroTier on this router. Dennis Kruyt Kruyt.org      Now I adopted EdgeOS (which is basically VyOS/Vyatta running on the EdgeRouter) to support ZeroTier from the native CLI with tab completion.</description>

      <description>FortiADC is is a application delivery controllers (loadbalancer). The devices metrics are availalbe via SNMP. So it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to collect those and display them in Grafana.
Pre Install Make sure you have installed InfluxDB as the time-series database Telegraf as collector first. Optional you can also include the FortiADC logs when they are in elasticsearch. I use the Greylog sollution for this.

The original idea for this is from Larry of the BBQ-Brethren Forum. This is my twist on that.

On my GitHub you can find a alertscript for Zabbix and Pushover. Pushover has also a dark theme, but the Zabbix graphs are still light. So there is an option in the script to invert the graphs.</description>

So first what is a etag header?
From WikipediA
 The ETag or entity tag is part of HTTP, the protocol for the World Wide Web. It is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for web cache validation, which allows a client to make conditional requests.</description>

      <description>Recently I got my hands on a nice all flash storage from Huawei, the Dorado 5000. Off course I wanted to see if my Grafana dashboard I created for the Huawei Oceanstor series was also working on the Dorado, most is working, but some mibs are different and not all performance metrics that are availble on the Oceanstor are on the Dorado. So I adjusted the Telegraf and Grafana dashboard to work correclty with the Dorado.</description>

Now most major sites are only available on https, and more and more IM are using encryption. But what about and old protocol email that is still very popular and we cant go without it any more. How can we increase security for this?
Of course you can use S/MIME or PGP and have end to end encryption, but the problem that in transit between mail servers the from, to, cc, and subject fields are not encrypted.</description>

      <description>I manage a couple of storages at work. I got a few Huawei OceanStor storages. v2 as wel v3 storages. There is some commercial tooling from Huawei available to gather metrics, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t fit my needs. I found out that all or almost all metrics that I need are available via SNMP. So it was not hard to setup a Grafana dashboard with all metrics.
Pre install Make sure you have installed InfluxDB as the time-series database Telegraf as the collector first.</description>

      <title>zswap metrics with Telegraf</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I discover zswap.
 zswap is a Linux kernel feature that provides a compressed write-back cache for swapped pages, as a form of virtual memory compression. Instead of moving memory pages to a swap device when they are to be swapped out, zswap performs their compression and then stores them into a memory pool dynamically allocated in the system RAM. Later writeback to the actual swap device is deferred or even completely avoided, resulting in a significantly reduced I/O for Linux systems that require swapping; the tradeoff is the need for additional CPU cycles to perform the compression.</description>

      <title>Equilux a Arduino clock</title>

      <description>I created a Arduino controled led clock with 60 rgb led&amp;rsquo;s. This one is inspired by the Equinox Clock from Bram Knaapen.
LED strip For the 60 RGB leds I use a string of RGB leds that I order directly from China, each of those leds has a LPD6803 IC. A arduino library for this string can be found at¬†adafruit&amp;rsquo;s github.
Time Keeping For time keeping I am using a a RTC DS1307 that is connected via I2C to pin A4 and A5 on the Arduino.</description>

      <description>Found an old magnetic card reader. I hooked it up to an Arduino to read magnetic cards.

      <title>Inlinefeed a Wordpress plugin to display RSS feeds</title>

      <description>This is not working any more just for historical purpose.
With the inlinefeed plugin you can display and embed RSS/ATOM feeds in your Wordpress posts and pages.
You can use the following shortcode within Wordpress:
[inlinefeed rss_feed_url=&amp;quot;http://feed.xml&amp;quot;]
NOTE: From version 2.0 you can only use the shortcode [inlinefeed], the old style rss:[URL]; doesn‚Äôt work anymore! If you upgrade
from a 1.xx version, then you must change from rss:[URL] to [inlinefeed rss_feed_url=‚Äùhttp://feed.</description>

      <description>Flickramio is a Greasemonkey script that put 2 google earth map‚Äôs next to the photo if the image is geotagged, so Flickr looks a little more like Panoramio.</description>
