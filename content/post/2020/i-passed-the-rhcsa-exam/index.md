Today I passed the Red Hat RHCSA exam with the maximum 300/300 **100%** score! üòÅ

I had a good feeling during the exam, and after about an hour I got the following email from Red Hat.

How I did this? I toke first the RHCSA Rapid Track 4 day course from Red Hat. After that I studied for about 20 hours, doing a lot of labs and using the following resources from Sander van Vugt. But that alone is not really enough, you should also have at least a couple of year experience with Linux and feel comfortable on the command line.
