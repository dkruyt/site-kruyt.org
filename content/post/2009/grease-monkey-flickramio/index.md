**This is not working any more just for historical purpose.**

[Flickramio](https://web.archive.org/web/20100507185629/http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/27101) is a Greasemonkey script that put 2 google earth map’s next to the photo if the image is geotagged, so Flickr looks a little more like Panoramio. And if you have already the Google Earth plugin installed, you even can see it in 3D.

Here some screenshots:
